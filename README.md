# Sorted-Linked-List

This program will store a collection of items and maintain the order of the items at all times. 

Following are the methods:

• add : Elements added to the collection in sorted order.
• remove: Elements specified are removed from the collection maintaing the current order.

The specified class is a generic class.
It can be used with any Comparable class. 
This works by combining two data types that add elements to the list in a random manner and then display the data in sorted order when function toString() is called. 
In all circumstances, the sorting order will be ascending alphabetical order.
